# Gesture-Command-Drones
A real-time gesture-based control system for autonomous drones. Hand movements are captured through a webcam and processed on a laptop using AI/ML models, which translate gestures into drone commands. The commands are then transmitted to the drone via telemetry, enabling intuitive, wireless, human-drone interaction.
